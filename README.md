Verify eIDAS Trust Anchor Generator and Connector Metadata Signer
===================================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/alphagov/verify-eidas-trust-anchor.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/alphagov/verify-eidas-trust-anchor)

### About Trust Anchor
[European identity schemes](https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/e-identification) each have unique metadata containing their identity providers and public keys. Every metadata file is signed with a country-specific key which allows metadata consumers to trust its authenticity.

We collect certificates for connected European countries into one place and sign them all together with a Verify key.

Our relying parties can trust the collection of certificates because of the [GOV.UK Verify](https://gov.uk/verify) certificate, and then trust individual metadata files by using the collection. This signed collection is called the ‘signed trust anchor’.

GOV.UK Verify expresses these anchors as [JSON Web Keys (JWK)](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7517) and serves them signed in compact [JSON Web Signature (JWS)](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7515) format.

### About Connector Metadata Signer

eIDAS specifies that we can only sign with RSASSA-PSS or ECDSA.  

However, since xmlsectool does not support either algorithms, we had to create this signer to sign Connector Metadata. 

Since RSASSA-PSS didn't work for yubikeys, we decided to go for ECDSA.

## This tool
This tool can:
* Operate on Trust Anchors
  * generate trust anchors from a country's certificate
  * aggregate many trust anchors together
  * sign the aggregated anchors into a full signed trust anchor
  * print a full signed trust anchor to show its constituent keys
* Operate on Connector Metadata
  * sign the metadata using RSA or ECDSA algorithm and validate the signed signature.

## Setup

The trust anchor depends on your system having version 0.17 of Open-SC installed, if you want to use the smart card functionality.
More info can be found https://github.com/alphagov/verify-metadata/blob/master/README.md#troubleshooting

## Build

Build the tool using `gradle`.

    # With Docker:
    docker build . --network host -t verify-eidas-trust-anchor:latest

    # For Unix:
    ./gradlew clean build installDist

    # For Windows:
    .\gradlew.bat clean build installDist

If you make changes, run the tests.

    # With Docker:
    docker build --network=host --target build -t verify-eidas-trust-anchor.test:latest .
    docker run --network=host verify-eidas-trust-anchor.test:latest gradle test

    # For Unix:
    ./gradlew test

## Run

The build process will produce a zip containing the executable (under bin/) under build/distributions. 
 
All commands by default will output to standard out. You can pass the `--output <file>` or `-o <file>` option to output to a file instead.

Under Docker, you'll want a volume for accessing files on your machine, so use something like:

    docker run --network=host -v /tmp:/host/tmp verify-eidas-trust-anchor:latest <COMMAND> <etc>

Otherwise, use:

    ./build/install/verify-eidas-trust-anchor/bin/verify-eidas-trust-anchor <COMMAND> <etc>

Use one of the above in place of <eidas-trust-tool-command> in the rest of this documentation.

### Import Trust Anchor

Generates a country's trust anchor by supplying the location of its metadata and its certificate or multiple certificates if the country has a certificate chain.

    <eidas-trust-tool-command> trust-anchor import "https://metadata.example.com/example-country.xml" path/to/signing.crt [path/to/signing_ca.crt [...]]

### Sign Trust Anchor with file

Aggregates and signs a collection of trust anchors by using a RSA private key supplied by a file. You can specify as many trust anchors as desired, including none.

    <eidas-trust-tool-command> trust-anchor sign-with-file \
      --key path/to/private-key.pk8 \
      --cert path/to/public-cert.crt \
      [country1.jwk [country2.jwk [...]]]

### Sign Trust Anchor with smartcard

Aggregates and signs a collection of trust anchors by using a smartcard (such as a Yubikey) that can be accessed using PKCS11.

    <eidas-trust-tool-command> trust-anchor sign-with-smartcard \
      --config pkcs11_config.txt \
      --key "Private Key alias" \
      --cert "Public Certificate alias" \
      --password 12345

This requires an external native library, such as [OpenSC](https://github.com/opensc/opensc). The config file will [passed to the PKCS11 provider as configuration](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/security/p11guide.html#P11Provider). For OpenSC, the correct config file might be:

    library = /usr/local/lib/opensc-pkcs11.so
    name = opensc

To find out the alias's of the certificates and keys you can use this command `keytool -list -v -keystore NONE -storetype PKCS11 -providerClass sun.security.pkcs11.SunPKCS11 -providerArg pkcs11_config.txt`

### Print Trust Anchor

Prints the human-readable JSON representation of each signed trust anchor passed, contained in a JSON array. If no signed trust anchors are passed, an empty array is printed.

    <eidas-trust-tool-command> trust-anchor print [trust-anchor.jwt [...]]

### Sign Connector Metadata with file

Signs a metadata.xml file by using private key and its corresponding cert supplied by a file. 
Supported algorithms "RSA" or "ECDSA".

    <eidas-trust-tool-command> connector-metadata sign-with-file \
      --key path/to/private-key.pk8 \
      --cert path/to/public-cert.crt \
      --algorithm ECDSA \
      metadata.xml

### Sign Connector Metadata with Smartcard/Yubikey

Signs a metadata.xml file by using a smartcard (such as a yubikey). 
Supported algorithms "RSA" or "ECDSA".

    <eidas-trust-tool-command> connector-metadata sign-with-smartcard \
      --config pkcs11_config.txt \
      --key "Private Key alias" \
      --cert "Public Certificate alias" \
      --password 12345
      --algorithm ECDSA \
      metadata.xml
